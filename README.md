# Design and Simulation of a Liquid Target for F-18 Isotope Production

## Project Overview
This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a niobium-based water target for the production of Fluorine-18 (¹⁸F) isotopes using an 18 MeV proton beam. The project was conducted during a summer internship at the **Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC)**, Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India.

**Internship Duration:** 07/05/2025 to 14/07/2025  
**Intern:** Nirupam Mondal  
**Guide:** Mr. Javed Akhter  
**Institution:** Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad — Mechanical Engineering

## Objective
To design and simulate a high-pressure, high-yield liquid target for efficient production of ¹⁸F isotopes via proton irradiation of ¹⁸O-enriched water, with a focus on thermal management and structural integrity.

## Key Features
- **Target Material:** Niobium cavity (high melting point, corrosion-resistant)
- **Beam Specifications:** 18 MeV proton beam, up to 50 µA current
- **Operating Pressure:** Up to 2.7 MPa
- **Cooling System:** Active water cooling for both target and beam window
- **Beam Window:** Havar foil supported by a cooled aluminum grid
- **Simulation Tools:** ANSYS Fluent (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA)


## Simulation Approach
- **CFD Analysis:** Transient thermal simulation with Eulerian multiphase model to study boiling and heat transfer.
- **FEA:** Structural and thermal analysis to ensure mechanical stability under high pressure and temperature.
- **Turbulence Model:** k-ε model for fluid flow behavior.
- **Phase Change Modeling:** Redlich-Kwong equation of state for vapor phase.

## Results
- Successful thermal management under high beam current (50 µA)
- Maximum temperature and pressure within safe operational limits
- Efficient heat dissipation via optimized cooling channels
- Validated against theoretical yield expectations (~342.1 mCi/µA)

## Applications
- Production of ¹⁸F for **Positron Emission Tomography (PET)** imaging
- Radiopharmaceutical synthesis for cancer diagnostics
- Advanced nuclear medicine infrastructure
